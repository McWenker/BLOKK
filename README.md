Blokk the Brave, a 2D-shoot'em'up platformer
By Tyler Brandt

Blokk the Brave is an in-development 2D platformer.
The reach goal is to create a shoot'em'up story game rife with side-quests and adventure.

-The gameplay is fast-paced and chaotic; featuring lasers, explosives, swords, and more.

-The pixel art and music is currently all made by me, but I may reach out to collaborators as the project progresses.

-The story is about a young hero, who will travel the world, make new allies, and seek to save their loved ones from a most wicked conquerer...

Currently, the first draft of the game's core engine is approaching completion.
It needs a lot of honing, edge-casing, performance-testing, etc.
As that progresses: I have recently begun writing the levels, story, and level design.

Thanks for taking the time to check this out!
Hoping to have updates to come.
